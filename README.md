# ![otel-photo](./docs/img/opentelemetry-logo-nav.png) OpenTelemetry Demo (w/ Ballerina)

## Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop Demo (featuring Ballerina)

This **forked** repository extends the "[**OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop**](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo)" demo by adding a simple Ballerina service. The *Astronomy Shop* was originally designed to illustrate the implementation of OpenTelemetry in
a near real-world, microservice-based
distributed system.


## Prerequisites
