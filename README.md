# ![otel-photo](./docs/img/opentelemetry-logo-nav.png) OpenTelemetry Demo (w/ Ballerina)

## Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop Demo (featuring Ballerina)

This **forked** repository extends the "[**OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop**](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo)" demo by adding a simple Ballerina service. The *Astronomy Shop* was originally designed to illustrate the implementation of OpenTelemetry in
a near real-world, microservice-based
distributed system.

## Quick start

1. Find the `otelcol-config-extras.yml` file in the `/src/otelcollector/` filder. Replace `<lightstep_access_token>` on line 13 with an [access token](https://docs.lightstep.com/docs/create-and-manage-access-tokens) from your Lightstep project.


### Original deployment instructions
You can be up and running with the demo in a few minutes. Check out the docs for
your preferred deployment method:

- [Docker](./docs/docker_deployment.md)
- [Kubernetes](./docs/kubernetes_deployment.md)

## Original Documentation

The authors of the *Astronomy Shop* have detailed documentation available in the [docs](./docs/) folder. If you're
curious about a specific feature the docs [README](./docs/README.md) can point
you in the right direction.
